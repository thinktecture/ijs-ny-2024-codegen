This session provides guidance on creating and using custom code generators using the tools provided by Angular and Nx Dev. If you are a fan of the Angular CLI or want to become more familiar with its capabilities this session is for you. The same engine that drives the Angular CLI can be used to create and run your custom code generators. These generators can create parts of or entire applications, libraries, services, components, and infrastructure code within a few seconds. Executors provide automation capabilities to streamline your developer and CI/CD workflows.
